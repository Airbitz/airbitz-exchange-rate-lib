# crypto-exchange-rates

This is my first Javascript library so a sort of learning exercise for now.

# TODO

* use NPM config to set API key, timeout, maybe other values
* another base class to handle ticker responses with multiple currency pairs
* get more exchange plugins in


Initial code started off from fork of donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker repo (https://github.com/donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker).
