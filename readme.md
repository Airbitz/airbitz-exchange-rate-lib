# crypto-exchange-rates

This is my first Javascript library so a sort of learning exercise for now.
It was originally forked from donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker repo (https://github.com/donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker).

Initial goal is to get this compatible with the Airbitz ABC API.

# TODO

* Add support for BraveNewCoin (need API key)
* Make sure objects and modules are done properly for API
* Move test scripts into mocha framework
* Add a test using mock ABC caller
* Make sure error handling is good
* Refactoring: base class or instance for axios to keep DRY
* Other refactoring and cleanup
