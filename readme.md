# crypto-exchange-rates

This is my first Javascript library so a sort of learning exercise for now.
It was originally forked from donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker repo (https://github.com/donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker).

Initial goal is to get this compatible with the Airbitz ABC API.

# TODO

* Make sure objects and modules are right for API
* Make sure error handling is right
* Refactoring: base class or instance for axios
