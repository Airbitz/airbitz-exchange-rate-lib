# crypto-exchange-rates

This is a Javascript library that provides an interface for retrieving cryptocurrency exchange rate values compatible with the [ABCExchangeRateLib](https://developer.airbitz.co/javascript/#abcexchangeratelib) API.

# TODO

* use NPM config to set API key, timeout, maybe other values
* another base class to handle ticker responses with multiple currency pairs
* get more exchange plugins in

Initial code started off from fork of donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker repo (https://github.com/donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker).
