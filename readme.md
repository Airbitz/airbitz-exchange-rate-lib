# crypto-exchange-rates

This is my first Javascript library so a sort of learning exercise for now.
It was originally forked from donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker repo (https://github.com/donbobvanbirt/coin-ticker).

Initial goal is to get this compatible with the Airbitz ABC API.

# TODO

Add support for BraveNewCoin (need API key)
Fix so it can use multiple currency pairs using concurrent promises
Move test scripts into mocha test framework
Put in complete and proper error handling
Add a test using mock ABC caller
Make sure objects and modules are done properly for API
Much refactoring and cleanup once I know best way to proceed
